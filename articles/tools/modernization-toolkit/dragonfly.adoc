= Preparing your Application with Modernization Toolkit Analyzer for Eclipse

Modernization Toolkit Analyzer for Eclipse is a tool to assess how well your applications fit the latest Vaadin versions when migrating with the Vaadin Modernization Toolkit. 

The Modernization Toolkit is a Vaadin product that accelerates your migration project. It has two components - a Dragonfly transpiler that does automated refactoring of your code, and a Feature Pack that identifies and isolates useful features from your application's current application platform and makes them available in Vaadin Flow.
